## Description:
The project is about writing a C++ computer game that allows the user to play a reasonable version of the New Haven game. The New Haven is a “tactical” game, the gaming rules are given [here](gamerules.pdf)

## Dependencies:
### CImg:
[CImg library](https://cimg.eu/) was used to create Graphical User Interface for the project. 

## Requirements:
### Windows:
+ Visual Studio >= 2019

### UNIX:
+ CMake version 3.15
+ Clang 
+ Clion (IDE) or simple Terminal

## Build Guide:
> **Note:**
>
> The project was built mostly on Visual Studio on Windows so it is compatible the most on Windows. 
> The proram may cause unexpected behaviour on other IDEs and platforms because of different checker, linter or compiler. 
> The proram uses CImg library for Graphical User Interface. Unfortunately, Apple has decided to stop supports for [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). OSX users might have to install additional XQuartz library to compile the project.
