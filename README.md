# New Haven


## Description:
The project is about writing a C++ computer game that allows the user to play a reasonable version of the New Haven game. The New Haven is a “tactical” game, the gaming rules are given in. The three assignments will be about the development of different parts of a project. Thus, every assignment will build upon code developed in the previous assignments.
